### Day 2: February 27, 2022
##### Second Day of this Challenge

**Today's Progress**: Completed 10 problems of the Basic Data Structures section of Javascript Algorithms and Data Structure.

**Thoughts:** Most of the times I am not able to solve the problem just because I skim throught what is written. If I could go ahead with more concentration it would've been easier.
